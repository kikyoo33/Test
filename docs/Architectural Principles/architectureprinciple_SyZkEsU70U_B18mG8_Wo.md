### Description


There should be business and IT processes that support corporate privacy requirements through the principle that it is the right of individuals (employees and customers) to determine when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.



### Rationale


Legislative requirements (such as the EU Privacy Directive and "Safe Harbor" principle) are increasingly requiring corporations to formally address privacy issues.
The Privacy Policy prescribes management’s direction to guide an organization in meeting their corporation’s privacy objectives according to its business needs. 
The privacy policy clearly demonstrates management’s commitment to an enterprise privacy program and clearly defines privacy responsibilities within the organization.  
Lack of a comprehensive privacy policy is likely to expose an organization to possible legal exposures as well as consumer objection.
The Data Protection Act and the law being drawn-up to support the new EU Data Protection Directive require protection of personal data.
80% rate privacy protection of consumer information as important in their selection of companies to patronize.



### Implications


Need to create a Privacy program with business and IT processes to support privacy business needs.
Need to train system architects and data modelers in the issues raised by data privacy and protection.
