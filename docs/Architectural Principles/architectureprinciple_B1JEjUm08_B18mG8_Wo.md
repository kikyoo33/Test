### Subject Area


Cloud services



### Topic


Accountability



### Ranked Priority


1



### Description


Cloud services will be formalized across IT organizational boundaries; service owners will be defined with responsibility and accountability for the successful process execution
.



### Rationale


An identified service owner with clearly defined roles and responsibilities ensures that the process will be kept up to date as business requirements and the environment changes over time 
Having an identified owner for a service provides a point of escalation/resolution when problems occur in the execution of the service
A single point of contact for each service will make it easier to evaluate and make service improvements when necessary



### Implications


Service owners must recognize that they are responsible to all groups that participate and/or have an interest in the process, be they within or outside the IT organization
Service Owners will be vested with the appropriate level of cross-functional authority and understanding of IT services and supporting processes
Appropriate authority, responsibility, training and capability must accompany service ownership
Service roles and responsibilities need to be enforced
